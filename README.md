# Meshtastic Lottery System

A real-time lottery system based on the Meshtastic network, which supports automatic device detection and fair prize drawing.

## üåü Features

  - **Automatic Entry** - Automatically join the lottery pool by sending a specific keyword over the Meshtastic network.
  - **Multi-level Prizes** - Configure multiple prize tiers and the corresponding number of winners.
  - **Real-time Status Sync** - The frontend can fetch the participant list, draw status, and results via an HTTP API.
  - **Fair Drawing** - The backend uses a random algorithm to ensure every participant has an equal chance of winning.
  - **User Identification** - Automatically fetches and displays the Meshtastic usernames of participants.
  - **State Reset** - Easily clear all participants and reset the system via an API to start a new lottery.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

### Frontend

  - **Next.js 15** - The React Framework for the Web
  - **TypeScript** - Strongly typed JavaScript
  - **Tailwind CSS** & **shadcn/ui** - For rapidly building modern UIs
  - **Lucide React** - Icon library

### Backend

  - **Python 3.8+**
  - **Flask** & **Flask-CORS** - To provide a lightweight HTTP API service
  - **Meshtastic Python API** - For communicating with Meshtastic hardware devices

#### Backend Core Architecture

To ensure the responsiveness of the web service (API) and continuous listening for Meshtastic messages, the backend uses a multi-threaded architecture:

1.  **Main Thread (Flask App)**:

      * Runs the Flask web server, responsible for receiving and processing HTTP requests from the frontend (e.g., checking status, triggering a draw, resetting the system). This is the primary channel for interacting with the user interface.

2.  **Meshtastic Listener Thread (`meshtastic_thread`)**:

      * An independent background daemon thread (`daemon=True`) is created at startup.
      * This thread is dedicated to connecting to the Meshtastic device via a serial interface (`SerialInterface`) and continuously listening for network messages.
      * It uses the `pubsub` library to subscribe to the `meshtastic.receive` event, passing all received data packets to the `on_meshtastic_receive` callback function.
      * **This design separates time-consuming I/O operations (waiting for LoRa messages) from the main thread, which prevents the web service from blocking and ensures the API can respond quickly at all times.**

3.  **Draw Execution Thread**:

      * When an administrator triggers a draw via the API, **another temporary background thread** is created to execute the `run_lottery` function.
      * This prevents the drawing process (which includes shuffling and delays) from blocking the API route, allowing the frontend to immediately receive an "Draw has started" response for a smooth user experience.

#### Meshtastic Interface Interaction Logic

The backend's interaction with Meshtastic is entirely event-driven:

  - **Connection & Subscription**: At startup, the listener thread attempts to connect to the device and subscribes to two core event types:

      - `meshtastic.connection`: Used to monitor the connection status with the device (e.g., "established" or "lost") and print logs to the console.
      - `meshtastic.receive`: **This is the most important event.** It is triggered whenever a data packet is received from the Meshtastic network.

  - **Message Handling (`on_meshtastic_receive` function)**:

      - **Lottery Participation**: The function checks if a received packet is a text message (`TEXT_MESSAGE_APP`). If so, it further checks if the message content includes the predefined keyword (`LOTTERY_KEYWORD`, default is "I want to enter"). If it matches, the sender's ID is added to the `lottery_participants` set to register them.
      - **User Info Update**: The function also listens for node info packets (`NODEINFO_APP`). When such a packet is received, it parses the user's ID and long name, updating them in the `node_info_map` dictionary. This allows the system to display user-friendly names instead of machine IDs for participants and winners.

## üì¶ Installation and Running

### Prerequisites

  - Node.js 18+
  - Python 3.8+
  - A Meshtastic device connected to your computer

### 1\. Clone the project

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd meshtastic-lottery
```

### 2\. Install backend dependencies

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors meshtastic
```

### 3\. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4\. Start the backend server

> **Note**: Ensure your filename matches the command. Based on the provided code, the filename is `background_server.py`.

```bash
python background_server.py
```

The backend server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 5\. Start the frontend development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will start at `http://localhost:3000`.
